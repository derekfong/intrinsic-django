<h3>Django Summary</h3>
<h4><a name="introduction" class="subhead">Introduction</a></h4>
<p>Django is an open-source web framework built using Python. Django was built primarily with the intent to be used to develop web applications that require a database back-end, and handling important user information. The main aspects of Django that developers will find beneficial are as follows: highly modular, developer-friendly, development efficient, encouragement of reusability, and importance of security.</p>

<h4><a name="modularity" class="subhead">Modularity</a></h4>
<p>Modularization is a technique used to separate a large component into smaller parts/modules that are well-defined. Django demonstrates modularity in that it strictly follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture. However, Django does make a slight modification to the architecture. In Django, the traditional View is called a Template and the traditional Controller is called a View. The purpose of using templates is to modularize the tasks of code development, design and content. However, MTV is essentially the same concept as MVC.</p>

<h4><a name="developer_friendly" class="subhead">Developer Friendly</a></h4>
<p>Web frameworks should be developer-friendly, meaning they should be easy for developers to learn, code, and manage. Django is developer-friendly in that it allows a developer to begin immediately after Django is setup. It comes preloaded with an integrated lightweight developer web server and the ability to use SQLite as the database back-end without any further installation. This means if a developer wants to start developing right away, it is less time consuming to set up a web server (e.g. Apache) or a database server (e.g. MySQL). This setup is also extremely useful and convenient for testing and prototyping, as the developer doesn’t have to use their production web server to test web application changes or updates and can be tested on their isolated local machine. Also, one of the features of Django that makes managing a web application seamless is the built-in administrative interface. When enabled, the administrative interface provides the main user with a simple, yet powerful web interface for managing the web application.</p>

<h4><a name="development_efficiency" class="subhead">Development Efficiency</a></h4>
<p>Choosing a framework in regards to being efficient in developing a web application, is very important. Fortunately, Django is quite development efficient. In particular, Django significantly reduces the lines of code needed due to the DRY philosophy (Don’t Repeat Yourself). The major benefit of this is that it reduces the chances of making human errors (e.g. typos) when coding, mainly because there is a smaller subset of code a developer would have to look over when reviewing code.</p>

<h4><a name="reusability" class="subhead">Reusability</a></h4>
<p>From a development perspective, it is generally ideal to be able to reuse components used in one particular system in other systems. Django provides an easy way to reuse applications, which makes applications loosely coupled. Essentially, all that needs to be done to reuse an application is to include the original in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py and copy the application to the current project. This saves time, as the developer does not need to waste time developing a component they already have created.</p>

<h4><a name="security" class="subhead">Security</a></h4>
<p>Security is always an important topic, especially when a web application handles user input. Django tries to alleviate some of the more common security concerns facing modern web applications. For example, the Django database API protects against SQL injection by automatically escaping certain SQL parameters. In terms of cross site request forgery, Django protects against this by verifying that each POST request is signed. To protect against cross-site scripting (XSS), Django automatically escapes user inputted data. However, it is still recommended that developers escape user inputted data as no automatic XSS will ever protect fully against XSS attacks.</p>

<h3>Comparisons of Django</h3>
<h4><a name="turbogears" class="subhead">TurboGears</a></h4>
	<p>TurboGears is also another popular Python framework that is based on Pylons . Both Django and TurboGears are modular as they both follow the MVC architecture. However, Django is more content management driven for data that is already known, whereas TurboGears provides more user interaction for dynamic content and is more preferred for general web applications.</p>

<p>As well, TurboGears has more toolkits for more experienced developers: Mochikit JavaScript support for AJAX, Kid (XML templating), Genshi (for parsing), Mako (non-XML templating), SQL Alchemy and SQLObject. In comparison to Django, it contains a more simplistic Object Relational Mapping (i.e. creating additional or editing existing models is more complicated in Django), and does not support AJAX, nor XML templating. Overall, Django is commented as being easier to use for those who do not have much experience with Python. As well, Django has a more prominent built-in administration setup, which TurboGears also lacks.</p>

<h4><a name="ruby_on_rails" class="subhead">Ruby on Rails</a></h4>
<p>In the article by Askins and Green, the applications written in Ruby on Rails and Django were compared based on the number of lines of code and time spent developing each portion of the application.  Overall, Django was only marginally ahead of Ruby on Rails in terms of lines of code (726 vs. 814); however, Django was well ahead of Ruby on Rails in lines of code for Ruby and Python implementation (320 vs. 517).  Django lagged significantly behind Ruby on Rails in lines of code for the templating system (406 vs. 297).</p> 

<p>In terms of time spent on implementation, Django again bested Ruby on Rails; implementation in Django was nearly half of the time spent on Ruby on Rails.  The largest differences between the two implementations were in the admin pages and the model creations.  These are two major features of Django and are areas where Django really exceeds compared to other web frameworks.  Generally though, Ruby on Rails is not nearly as developer friendly or development efficient as Django.  In Django, exactly 7 lines of codes are required to setup the admin page for use with your app, 4 of which only need to be uncommented. Beyond that, it is also simple to further customize the admin page.</p>
